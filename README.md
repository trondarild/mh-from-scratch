# Metropolis Hastings from scratch
Implementation of Metropolis-Hastings sampling from scratch, based on https://towardsdatascience.com/from-scratch-bayesian-inference-markov-chain-monte-carlo-and-metropolis-hastings-in-python-ef21a29e25a

## TODO
1. pde version appears not to converge to the correct number
 1. correct for std = 1, but otherwise too high; perhaps due to incorrect modification of normalized sample
